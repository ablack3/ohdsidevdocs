# OHDSI Software Introduction

OHDSI Software is a large collection of tools with the goal of enabling a community to generate evidence from observational data that leads to better health and better care. While there are many software projects in OHDSI a subset of that software is considered

For every one officially supported OHDSI software project there are many more community projects. The reason for the distinction is that OHDSI software projects exist in varying stages of development, maturity, and adoption. Officially supported OHDSI Software consists of a set of tools that the OHDSI developer community has committed to supporting and that form the backbone of OHDSI's evidence generation machinery.

The documentation on this website is specific to officially supported OHDSI software and meant for the OHDSI software developers who maintain and improve this software. For the purposes of this documentation "OHDSI Software" will refer to Officially supported OHDSI Software and "Community developed Software" will refer to any OHDSI software that is not officially supported.
